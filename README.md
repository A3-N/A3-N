# Welcome, Fellow Hacker 🔓

I'm **Adriaan** (aka. A3 or donnager), a hacker, a problem-solver, and a **jack of all trades**, mastering *some* of them along the way. This repository is my digital playground where I share whatever little side projects, tooling, or experiments I manage in my free time.

## About Me 🕵️‍♂️
- 🖥️ **OS**: Running Arch, btw.
- 💡 **Work**: My real work is confidential, so I keep most of it under wraps.
- 🔧 **Skills**: I dabble in many things—languages, tools, and techniques. Call me a hacker, by mindset not memorised tricks.
- 💼 **What I Share Here**: Whatever I have time for—mostly side projects, tooling, and code that I reference on my [blog](https://adriaanbosch.com).
  
## Projects 🔥
- 🛠️ **Side Projects**: When I have a free moment, you'll find some tooling or random experiments I’ve built here.
- 📚 **Blog**: I frequently reference my code in the [articles on my website](https://adriaanbosch.com).

## What I Use 🔌
- **Languages**: I know a little of many. You’ll see me dip into whatever makes the job easiest.
- **Tools**: If it helps with hacking, I’ll use it—everything from containers to obscure scripting languages.

## Work is Confidential 🔐
Most of my work is not for public view, but anything I can share, I’ll leave it here in this repo. I’ll also link back to it in my blogs.

## Hacker Mode: Activated ⚡
I live for solving problems, learning new things, and building things that go boom—digitally, of course.
