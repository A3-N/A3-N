# Welcome, Fellow Hacker 🔓

I'm **Adriaan** (aka. A3, A3-N or donnager), a hacker, a problem-solver, and a **jack of all trades**, mastering *some* of them along the way.

## About Me 🕵️‍♂️
- 🖥️ **OS**: Running Arch, btw.
- 💡 **Work**: My real work is confidential, so I keep most of it under wraps.
- 🔧 **Skills**: I dabble in many things—languages, tools, and techniques. Call me a hacker, by mindset not memorised tricks.

## Ekse ⚡
I live for solving problems, learning new things, and most important - I want to **understand**.

I make tools, hack for the challenge not the gain and some tomfoolery around of course.
